        content:"Few people have the opportunity to work with a person full of joy and constant desire of becoming a better version of himself – but I did when I worked with Raouf. I was particularly impressed by Raouf’s ability to handle even the toughest kids and co-workers. He is a good listener, has great communication skills and public speaking, he knows how to motivate each person and he inspires through his speeches. Raouf is adaptable, resourceful, innovative, highly organized, empathetic and collaborative, friendly and his biggest asset is his willingness to learn. As a team member or a leader, Raouf Madani earns my highest recommendation."
